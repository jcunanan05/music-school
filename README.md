# Music School Project

Hi! This is a music school project that I'll try to build!

### Requirements:
* Working product site
* Show what the school is, what they teach, and the instrument they offer
* Display the logo

### Plans:
* Learn webpack, and integrate sass, babel, uglify, and dev and prod environments?
  * Decided to stick with learning react via NextJS
* Full grid site? or use Bulma, sass and edit variables? or combine grid and bulma-sass?? hmmm...
  * More of flexbox. Because bulma is a flexbox framework
  * Used NextJS-sass plugin
* include png school Logo (?)
  * planning to include 3 resolutions (mobile, tablet, high res logo)
* Research some visual ideas
  * try wireframing with balsamiq first
* BEM__Naming (?)
  * for sure.

### Work today:
- Style / Build the sections page
- Sections content
- Add `p` on box content`
