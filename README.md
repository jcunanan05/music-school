# Music School Project

Hi! This is a music school project that I'll try to build!

Requirements:
* Working product site
* Show what the school is, what they teach, and the instrument they offer
* Display the logo

Plans:
* Learn webpack, and integrate sass, babel, uglify, and dev and prod environments?
* Full grid site? or use Bulma, sass and edit variables? or combine grid and bulma-sass?? hmmm...
* include png school Logo (?)
* Research some visual ideas
* BEM__Naming (?)
